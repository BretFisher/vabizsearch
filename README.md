WIP: Attempt at Front End for VA Business API
=====================================

-- not really usable yet -- 2/22/2015

Using Meteor http://www.meteor.com

## Goals
- Single google-like search of people, places, entities
- Easy discovery. Server caches datasets of your search and lets you discover relationships quickly.
- Use Meteor niceties: miniMongo, Websockets, server-side data gathering, to streamline UX.
